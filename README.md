# URL-Shortener
A URL shortener that takes some long, unwieldy link and turns it into a shorter link. 

# Purpose
This shortened link means whoever sees your ad has an easy-to-type URL to visit, rather than having to type some long, unintelligible string of text where they're almost guaranteed to make a mistake (and they certainly won't include your tracking information).
